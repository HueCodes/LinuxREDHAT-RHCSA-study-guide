  # RHCSA Exam Preparation Notes

  

## Overview
This repository contains my personal notes, cheat sheets, and practice commands from preparing for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam (EX200). I passed on my first attemptâ€”yay! If you're gearing up for it, these might help you navigate the Linux basics like file systems, user management, networking, and more.

## My Study Journey
- **Total Study Time**: ~70 hours over 2-3 months (part-time).
- **Resources Used**:
  - Books: "RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide" by Michael Jang.
  - YouTube: Sander van Vugt's tutorials and free RHCSA walkthroughs.
  - Paid Course: Udemy's "RHCSA 9 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9) Complete Video Course" by Mumshad Mannambeth.
- **Tips**: Focus on hands-on practice in a VM (I used VirtualBox with RHEL). The exam is performance-based, so simulate real scenarios!

## Repo Contents
- `/notes/`: Organized Markdown files by topic (e.g., storage, services, security).
- `/cheatsheets/`: Quick-reference PDFs and scripts.
- `/practice/`: Sample labs and Ansible playbooks for automation practice.
- `install_guide.md`: How to set up your study environment.
